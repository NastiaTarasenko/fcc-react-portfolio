# ðŸŒŸ FreeCodeCamp React Portfolio ðŸŒŸ

This repository contains my learning projects from FreeCodeCamp, rewritten in React. The main goal is to deepen my understanding of React, Redux, and modern frontend practices through hands-on experience.

## Current Projects

### Random Quote Generator (Your Daily Quote)

A simple app that displays random quotes with their authors. Users can get new quotes by clicking a button and share quotes on Twitter. The project demonstrates interactive UI components and state management with React and Redux.

### 25 + 5 Clock

An interactive timer where you can set custom session and break lengths, start/stop the countdown, and reset everything to default values. It automatically switches between work sessions and breaks, playing a sound when each phase ends. The project focuses on precise timer logic, state management with Redux, and handling edge cases like length limits and pause/resume behavior.

## Purpose

These projects were originally built as part of the FreeCodeCamp Frontend Development Libraries course. Now, I'm combining them into one React app to improve project organization, routing, and build something bigger.

Styling wasnâ€™t the top priority, but I tried to keep the design nice and clean â€” starting from FCC examples and tweaking it a bit to make it more polished.

Overall, this is a playground to experiment with React and Redux, practice code structuring, logic handling, and performance improvements. More projects will be added over time.
