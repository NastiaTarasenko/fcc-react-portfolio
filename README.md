# ðŸŒŸ FreeCodeCamp React Projects ðŸŒŸ

This repository contains my learning projects from FreeCodeCamp, rewritten in React. The main goal is to deepen my understanding of React, Redux, and modern frontend practices through hands-on experience.

## Current Projects

### Random Quote Generator (Your Daily Quote)

A simple app that shows random quotes with their authors. Users can get new quotes by clicking a button and share quotes on Twitter. This project focuses on building interactive UI components and managing state with React and Redux.

## Purpose

These projects were originally built as part of the FreeCodeCamp Frontend Development Libraries course. Now, I'm combining them into one React app to improve project organization, routing, and build something bigger.

Styling wasnâ€™t the top priority, but I tried to keep the design nice and clean â€” starting from FCC examples and tweaking it a bit to make it more polished.

Overall, this is a fun way to experiment with React and Redux, practice structuring code, handling logic, and improving performance. Iâ€™m planning to add more projects and routing soon.
