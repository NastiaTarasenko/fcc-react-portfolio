# ðŸŒŸ FreeCodeCamp React Portfolio ðŸŒŸ

This repository contains my learning projects from FreeCodeCamp, rewritten in React. The main goal is to deepen my understanding of React, Redux, and modern frontend practices through hands-on experience.

## Current Projects

### Random Quote Generator (Your Daily Quote)

A simple app that displays random quotes with their authors. Users can get new quotes by clicking a button and share quotes on Twitter. The project demonstrates interactive UI components and state management with React and Redux.

### 25 + 5 Clock

An interactive timer where you can set custom session and break lengths, start/stop the countdown, and reset everything to default values. It automatically switches between work sessions and breaks, playing a sound when each phase ends. The project focuses on precise timer logic, state management with Redux, and handling edge cases like length limits and pause/resume behavior.

### Calculator

A playful calculator page that supports basic arithmetic, decimals, and reset functionality. It features a walking cat animation and theme switching for a fun, interactive experience. The project demonstrates dynamic UI rendering, input validation, and state management with React and Redux.

## Purpose

These projects were originally built as part of the FreeCodeCamp Frontend Development Libraries course. The original goal was to combine them into one React app, improve project organization, and practice routing.

During development, I added extra features like theme switching, playful animations, and lazy loading for pages. Now itâ€™s a unified app with multiple interactive toolsâ€”a place to experiment with React and Redux, practice component structure, state management, and performance optimizations.

Styling wasnâ€™t the main focus, but I tried to keep the design clean and polished, adding my own touches to make the experience more engaging.

## Technologies

- React
- Redux (used intentionally even when simpler solutions might exist to better understand it)
- Vite (for fast development and build)
- CSS Modules (scoped component styling)
